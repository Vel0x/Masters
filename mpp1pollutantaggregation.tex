\subsection{Pollutant Aggregation}\label{aggregation}

\todo[inline]{Somewhere I need to talk about generating a single value to map. Current idea:

Find a fatal value for each pollutant and give this a value of 100
Find an equation that fits the concentration volume and the severity of it
Get a value of severity from each pollutant and calculate an air quality value from it (mean, mode, median, max?)
}
