\subsection{Data Packet}

In order to effectively simulate a real life scenario we needed a correct amount of data. To do this we first need to know what measurements we are taking. As discussed in section~\ref{somesectionhere}, we decided to monitor certain chemicals. As such I have designed a packet which will be able to store all this data, and so will enable us to simulate the scenario effectively. 

\begin{center}
    \begin{savenotes} 
        \begin{tabular}{ | c | c |}
            \hline
            Metric & Size (bytes)\\ \hline
            Timestamp & 4 \\
            Bus Id & 2 \\
            CO_{2} & x \\
            O_{2} & y \\
            etc & ... \\
            \hline
            Total & 16 \\
            \hline
        \end{tabular}
