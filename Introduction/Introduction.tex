        \begin{itemize}
            \item Have a motivation behind the work
            \item Indicate the goals of the project in crisp terms (simulation is a means)
                \begin{itemize}
                    \item Performance study of an urban mobile air quality monitoring system leveraging public transport vehicles:
                        \begin{itemize}
                            \item Effects of various parameters including number of roadside access points, storage capacity (queue size) on mobile sensor platforms.
                            \item The benefits of opportunistic forwarding between mobiles
                        \end{itemize}
                    \item Comparative evaluation of common spatial prediction methods for blanket air quality estimation in a city.
                    \item Use Edinburgh as a case study and simulation as the methodology (specifically, OMNeT++)
                    %\item Evaluate the performance of mobile air quality sensors on Lothian Buses, and the effects of varying different parameters including the number of access points, measurement queue size and the use of opportunistic forwarding.
                    %\item Evaluate the effectiveness of simple interpolation methods in air quality prediction based on sparse input.
                \end{itemize}
            \item Accomplishments in terms of addressing those goals
            \item This is how the rest of the report looks
        \end{itemize}
