\subsection{Air Quality Models}\label{airquality}

When measuring air quality it is difficult to calculate a single value which accurately represents the pollution level. In order to do this successfully we must use a model of some kind. 

\subsubsection{Land-Use Regression Model (LUR)}\label{lur}

Land-use Regression models are they standard approach in determining this value. LUR uses concentration measures, location information, and information about the area.
