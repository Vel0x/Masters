\section{Interpolation and Extrapolation Models}\label{interpolation}


   * Interpolation and Extrapolation (mainly a question of considering different schemes and models and talking about their effectiveness)


      * Discuss state of the art
      * Comparison and contrasting


When measuring air quality values are only generally generated at points where sensors can easily be placed. In order to effectively map air pollution a method of calculating the missing values must be found. There are many different models which can be used to calculate missing values.


\subsection{Land-Use Regression Model (LUR)}\label{lur}

Land-use Regression models are they standard approach in determining missing date in air quality measurements. LUR uses the concentration measure of the pollutant, location information, and information about the area (such as is it a built up area, the altitude, are there factories nearby, etc.).
