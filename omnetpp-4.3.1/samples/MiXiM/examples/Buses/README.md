This folder should contain a database named 'database.sql' which contains the
positions of the buses every second over the entire data set. Unfortunately I 
could not include this with the submission as it was too large. If you plan on 
on running the simulator (you will need a device running OS X 10.8) then you
will need to contact me for this database file.
