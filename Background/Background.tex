    In the first year of this project much of the initial research was done. In this section some of the key topics will be briefly discussed.

    \subsection{Geostatistical Mapping}
    
        It was discovered that when working with an actual data set, obtained by using a sensor built by a previous years student, \emph{Eric Staples}, work would have to be performed in order to make use of the data effectively. Generally, heat maps are used to show various concentrations and levels of variables in a two dimensional environment and so the same would be used in this project. The interpolation method which should be used was a more difficult problem. Initial research suggested that some form of convolution filter, or blur, when applied to a sufficiently dense data set would give a reasonable approximation, however this was later found to be incorrect, and would not apply to a sparse data set likely to be generated from any experiments. Further research showed that when interpolating environmental data such as pollutant levels, the most common method is kriging, a statistical method which fits a curve to the data set. Kriging is used as the basis for many advanced models~\cite{regressionkriging}.

    \subsection{Compressive Sampling}

        Compressive sampling was looked into briefly as a method of enhancing our data collection methodology. The basis behind compressive sampling is that more measurements are taken in areas of high variance, with less measurements taken in areas of lower variance~\cite{compressivesampling}. Essentially this is a variable method of conforming to the Nyquist theorem, which is discussed further in section~\ref{prediction_evaluation_motivation}. The work on this area was discovered to involve much background research into the nature of the pollutants and the areas they build up and would not work if there were a change to this environment. As such this technique was not used in the final solution.

    \subsection{Sensor Creation}

        Initially this project was intended to have a practical component, however external circumstances restricted this and the physical implementation was cancelled. Before this change, research was done into building a physical sensor using cheap, off the shelf parts, which would be dynamically calibrated using the techniques discussed in the D. Hasenfratz et al. paper titled ``On-the-fly calibration of low cost gas sensors''\cite{ontheflycalibration}. Individual sensors were researched and purchased in order to make a prototype, before the physical implementation was cancelled. 
    

\section{Mobile Sensing and Air Quality Monitoring}\label{background_mobile_sensing_models}

\plan{Write a paragraph discussing different mobile sensing models (sensors moving, sensors fixed but data collectors moving etc.) There was a survey I pointed you to during the earlier phase of your project and which cited in one of your earlier reports. After this discussion, state which specific model is adopted in your project with a reasonable justification. 

Then write a paragraph discussing the OpenSense project and other air quality monitoring projects or systems you are aware of including Scottish Air Quality monitoring network. You can also mention the UrbanAir project from Microsoft Research Asia.}

\section{Radio Signal Propagation Models}


    When implementing a simulation of wireless communications one of the decisions which must be made is which radio propagation model to use. These propagation models define how different signals behave under different conditions and are generally given in terms of a mathematical equation. Using these models we can enter information about our radio signal, such as frequency, transmitter power and receiver power,  and gain information such as the signal to noise ratio of the signal over some distance.

    In Omnet++, which is the simulator we end up using, there are six different models implemented. These models are ``Free Space Model'', ``Two Ray Ground Model'', ``Rice Model'', ``Rayleigh Model'', ``Nakagami Model'' and ``Log Normal Shadowing Model''. The Free Space model is the simplest of these models and acts the same way a signal would in ``free space''. That is to say, a space where there is no interference from external signals, or the original signal through reflection, refraction or diffraction. This model is usually used as a component of other models and formulae~\cite{friis1946note}.

    The two ray ground model is only slightly more advanced, in that it takes into account a singular reflection from some boundary, usually the ground~\cite{tworaygroundmodel}.

    The log normal shadowing model builds on this. This model has two variable parameters, $\gamma$ and $\sigma$, which are used to tune the model to the environment. Other formulations have up to 5 parameters. These parameters provide information about the types of obstacles they are likely to experience and are generally provided through empirical analysis~\cite{goldhirsh1998handbook}.

    Nakagami's distribution is a variation of a gamma distribution in that we provide two parameters to this model, $m$ and $\Omega$, which control the shape of the distribution. In order to achieve a propagation model, this distribution is applied to the power level~\cite{nakagamipowerlevel}.

    The Rice model, also known as the Longley-Rice model, has origins in telecommunications. Originally designed to take into account the terrain, it can require up to 11 input parameters~\cite{ricemodel}. This model is complicated, but provides accurate information, and indeed is used by the US Federal Communications Commission~\cite{fcclongleyrice}.

    The final model is the Rayleigh model. This model works by assuming that fading happens according to a random distribution when passing through some material. This model has shown promising results in dense urban environments~\cite{rayleighmanhattan}.
