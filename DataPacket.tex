\subsubsection{Data Packet}

In order to effectively simulate a real life scenario we needed a correct amount of data. To do this we first need to know what measurements we are taking. As discussed in section~\ref{research_airquality}, we decided to monitor certain chemicals. As such I have designed a packet which will be able to store all this data, and so will enable us to simulate the scenario effectively. 

\begin{center}
	\begin{tabular}{ | c | c |}
		\hline
		Metric & Size (bytes)\\ \hline
		Timestamp & 4 \\
		Bus Id & 2 \\
		\cee{CO_{2}} & x \\
		\cee{O_{2}} & y \\
		etc & ... \\
		\hline
		Total & 16 \\

	\end{tabular}
