\subsection{Challenge Identification}\label{challenges}

Challenges:

\begin{itemize}
	\item What to measure?
	\item Deployment considerations
	\item Calibration
	\item How I collect the data (in a way that is both efficient and responsive)
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Talk about opportunistically uploading data
	\end{itemize}
	\item Interpolating and extrapolation
	\begin{itemize}
	    \item A few paragraphs about each one
	    \item Are things like LUR relevant when I have more dense sampling of the space
	    \item Find out which model is the best for calculating air quality
	    \begin{itemize}
	        \item Implement several different models and see which is the most efficient by validating
	        \item Find the pros and cons of each one (such as statistical models never being applied to these problems)
	    \end{itemize}
	    \item Compare and contrast (such as which schemes have these been used in)
	    \begin{itemize}
	        \item Talk about the constraints of each one
	    \end{itemize}
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
