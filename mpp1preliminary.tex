\section{Preliminary Work}\label{preliminary}


Conclusion is finding the right approach to deployment and what sort of gases should I measure and the platform I should use (how can I engineer a platform based on this device)

During the course of working on the MPP and MPP1 reports, preliminary work was carried out in order to efficiently form a work plan. In this preliminary work the challenges which would be faced were identified, as well as a background report on the definition of \emph{air quality}, the creation of heat maps, which are the standard representation format for display air quality information \todo{CITE ME}. Finally some research was carried out into building an appropriate sensor platform.
